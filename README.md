This repository contains my solution to the Udacity Self-Driving Car NanoDegree Semantic Segmentaton Project

This repository contains the following notable files:

* `main.py` : Implementation of the semantic segmentation fully convolutional model/
* `./runs/` folder: stores output of model runs on image data. Parts of the image segmented as "road" are highlighted in green.
* `Semantic Segmentation.ipynb` : Contains both main and helper in a Jupyter notebook (used for development).

## Instruction for running

* ensure Tensorflow with GPU support is available on your machine
* run `python main.py`

## Comments on the Fully Convolutional Model Implementation
